# Introduction
Advancements in healthcare technology are revolutionizing disease diagnosis, offering new ways to improve patient outcomes. Our project aims to develop a predictive model for disease diagnosis using a dataset of health-related attributes. These attributes include cholesterol levels, hemoglobin, platelets, white and red blood cells, insulin, BMI, blood pressure, triglycerides, liver enzymes, heart rate, and more. The goal is to accurately classify individuals as diseased or non-diseased.

By leveraging machine learning, this model will assist healthcare providers in making more precise diagnoses, supporting early detection, personalized treatment plans, and optimized healthcare resources.
